# Getting to know Firebase
Before working too in-depth or adding features to an app that relies on Firebase, it's a good idea to review the documentation and understand how Firebase expects you to do things.

The Cloud Firestore team has a really great video series that walks through the basics of working with Firebase's Firestore, which this app relies on. See: [Get to know Cloud Firestore](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-K7zZEsYLluG5MCVEzXAQ7ACZBCuZgZ).
